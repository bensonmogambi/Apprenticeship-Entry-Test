If a page loads too slowly, here are common causes and fixes:

Large Images – Images that aren’t compressed make the page heavy.
- Fix: Compress and resize images, use modern formats like WebP.

Too Many HTTP Requests – Too many scripts, CSS files, or assets increase load time.
- Fix: Combine/minify CSS & JavaScript files, and use caching/CDN.

Slow Database Queries – Unoptimized queries can delay responses.
- Fix: Add proper indexes, reduce unnecessary queries, and use caching for repeated data.
